            the rank and are actually smaller than the females. Though hyenas are considered scavengers,hyenas are actually superb hunters and hunt most of their 
            prey. Actually,lions steals more food from hyenas more times than hyenas steal from lions. Hyenas have the strongest bite force of any mammal on the wild. Meru national
